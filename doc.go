Package btcutil provides bitcoin-specific convenience functions and types.

Block Overview

A Block defines a bitcoin block that provides easier and more efficient
manipulation of raw wire protocol blocks.  It also memoizes hashes for the
block and its transactions on their first access so subsequent accesses don't
have to repeat the relatively expensive hashing operations.

Tx Overview

A Tx defines a bitcoin transaction that provides more efficient manipulation of
raw wire protocol transactions.  It memoizes the hash for the transaction on its
first access so subsequent accesses don't have to repeat the relatively
expensive hashing operations.
